# FIXME: will not compile but the problem is when linking to gtk-3. It will miss the
# libraries xi, xrandr, xcursor, xdamage, epoxy, atk, atk-bridge-2.0. It seems the problem
# is gtk-3 does not gives these dependencies in the pkg-config file.
# I have done a fork as lhelper-org/libgedit-gtksourceview but nothing is done
# there as the problem lies in gtk-3.
