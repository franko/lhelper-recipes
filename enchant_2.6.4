# The problem with enchant and its configure script is it doesn't
# see aspell if it is non in the standard system location.
# In addition it tries to run groff with html format to run the
# documentation and it does require special utils installed and
# cannot be disabled.
#
# dist_man_MANS =
# nodist_doc_DATA =
#
# from src/Makefile after configure.
