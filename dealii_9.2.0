# RECIPE known problems:
# The generated pkg-config file is names deal.II_release which seems unorthodox
# at least because of the "_release" suffix.
# The pkg-config file also seems to be installed in the wrong path on
# Linux.

# The build takes a lot of memory so to limit the risk of thrashing
# the system we limit the build to a single thread.
# If should be safe to use parallel build on system that has
# Memory(Gb) > (N + 2) * 4
# where N is the number of cores.

# Creating a shared library on Windows does not work because there
# are too many exported symbols.
